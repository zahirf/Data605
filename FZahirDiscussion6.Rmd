Discrete Conditional Probability

Problem 18 page 152

A doctor assumes that a patient has one of three diseases: $d_{1}$, $d_{2}$, $d_{3}$
Before any test, he assumes an equal probability of each disease
He carries out a test that will be positive with probability 0.8 if the patient has $d_{1}$, 0.6 if he has $d_{2}$, and 0.4 if he has $d_{3}$
Given that the outcome of the test was positive, what probabilities should the doctor now assign to the three possible diseases?

Solution:

First, let's summarize the information that we have. 

We will denote the equal probability of having one of the diseases as p

$P(d_{1}) = p$,
$P(d_{2}) = p$,
$P(d_{3}) = p$,
$P(+|d_{1}) = 0.8$,
$P(+|d_{2}) = 0.6$,
$P(+|d_{3}) = 0.4$

From the above we can calculate $P(+)$ as

$$P(+) = P(+|d_{1})P(d_{1}) + P(+|d_{2})P(d_{2}) + P(+|d_{3})P(d_{3}) = p \left ( 0.8 + 0.6 + 0.4\right ) = 1.8p$$
We need to calculate

$P(d_{1}|+)$,
$P(d_{2}|+)$,
$P(d_{3}|+)$

1. $P(d_{1}|+) = \frac{P(d_{1}\cap +)}{P(+)} = \frac{0.8p}{1.8p} = \frac{4}{9}$

2. $P(d_{2}|+) = \frac{P(d_{2}\cap +)}{P(+)} = \frac{0.6p}{1.8p} = \frac{1}{3}$

3. $P(d_{3}|+) = \frac{P(d_{3}\cap +)}{P(+)} = \frac{0.4p}{1.8p} = \frac{2}{9}$
